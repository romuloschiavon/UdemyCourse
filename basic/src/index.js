  * So basically all the classes I took so far only taugh me things I already knew, like the diferrence between let, const and basic usage like strings
  numbers, boolean, counters, increments, decrements and I didn't wrote them all in the code, this course is only to strengh my base and help me build my 
  advanced knowledge, so far the course helped me answer a few questions I had. And learn a few basic things I didn't knew (that is always good to learn)
  so if I didn't wrote a lot so far is because of that!
